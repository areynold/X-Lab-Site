<p>X-Lab combines visionary leadership, risk tolerance, and technological acumen 
to influence legislative and regulatory debates. X-Lab is future-focused -- 
its projects include looking at the implications for disruptive eventualities 
like the collapse of today's traditional manufacturing chain; electromagnetic jaywalking; 
digital feudalism; and, the paradox of “when smart is dumb" (i.e., the myriad problems 
with today's conceptualizations of the Internet of Things).</p>

<p>X-Lab is created to be an open sandbox that brings together technologists 
for specific projects and initiatives and is built to enable it and its projects 
to spin out quickly -- it is an incubator that develops what’s next in tech policy.
