X-Lab combines visionary leadership, risk tolerance, and technological acumen to influence legislative and regulatory debates. X-Lab is future-focused -- its projects include looking at the implications for disruptive eventualities like the collapse of today's traditional manufacturing chain; electromagnetic jaywalking; digital feudalism; and, the paradox of "when smart is dumb" (i.e., the myriad problems with today's conceptualizations of the Internet of Things).

X-Lab is created to be an open sandbox that brings together technologists for specific projects and initiatives and is built to enable it and its projects to spin out quickly -- it is an incubator that develops what's next in tech policy.

# Mission
As more and more aspects of our lives -- the way we live, work and communicate -- are computer-mediated -- the lines are blurring between technology, law, and policy. Today, decisions about how we interact with technology -- and increasingly, how technology interacts with us -- are being made by key decision-makers that will set a trajectory for decades to come. These decisions must be informed by a principled and ethical stance, and not merely market forces, otherwise our inalienable human rights will be rendered obsolete by the actions and inactions of these same decision-makers.

X-Lab combines the technological acumen of world experts across a variety of domains to analyze the implications of today's technological battles. X-Lab anticipates the disruptions and dystopian outcomes of different policy options and aims to help humanity change course -- through innovative policy interventions, privacy-conscious technology development, and novel business models.
