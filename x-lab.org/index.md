Imagine a world where safe, free, ubiquitous communications is available to everyone on the planet.  What happens when distributed manufacturing disrupts today's global manufacturing chain? What if nothing you do online or in your home could ever be kept private? What if you no longer had control of your personal devices -- from home appliances to implanted augmentations?

X-Lab is an innovative, future-focused initiative built to anticipate, develop and respond to what's next in tech policy.  X-Lab is working to ensure that no one ever has to choose between their fundamental human rights and the technologies they want to use.
