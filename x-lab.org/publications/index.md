<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: left;">Dear Friends,</span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://action.mdcteam.com/images/Sascha.png" align="right" height="138" width="106" />As leaders who shape the conversations, technologies and </span>policies that affect every aspect of our Internet lives, I want to share my Tech Note with you, a new series that will serve to keep us connected and engaged. It will also serve as a forum to share insights on how we can remain vigilant and continue to advance the cause of protecting our civil rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><span>Whether it's leveraging lessons from the past, brainstorming solutions for today's challenges, or anticipating the disruptive technologies of tomorrow, X-Lab is dedicated to going beyond conventional paradigms, staying above partisanship and bringing together the best and brightest minds in the many fields that intersect with the digital tools that we depend on in our daily lives.</span></p>
<p>I launched X-Lab just a few months ago, and we’ve already announced our first class of Fellows. This impressive group, which you can find more about below, will continue to help us build our programs and engage thinkers, dedicated journalists, and honest political leaders who are committed to ensuring that our technological innovations work with us, rather than against us. Our success will be determined by our ability to respond nimbly, move quickly between the local and the global, and stay ahead of bureaucratic nay-saying. All with the highest technological acumen, open mindset, and a bit of humor.</p>
<p>Take a look at the features below and let me know what you think. I look forward to your support, collaboration, and ideas.</p>
<p><span>Best,</span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Why over-hyping FireChat puts users at risk</strong></span>. </span><span>“</span><span>I'm more than a little scared about the over-hyping of FireChat -- not because it's not a cool technology, but because it's being </span><span>way</span><span> oversold for a use case where people may be surveilled. [...] in this case, the over-hyping could be putting </span><span>a lot</span><span> of people at substantial risk (and could create substantial blow-back for many other important mesh and circumvention tech projects that are doing great work all around the globe).” [</span><strong>TechPresident, </strong><a href="http://techpresident.com/news/25294/dangers-grid-social-networking-hong-kong-and-beyond"><span>The Dangers of Off-Grid Social Networking in Hong Kong and Beyond</span></a><span>, 10/02/14]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Why Americans overpay for poor cellular service.</strong></span><span> “The United States lacks meaningful competition in its cellular market sector, which leads to higher cell plan prices than a growing list of other countries,” said</span><span> </span><a href="http://newamerica.net/user/70"><span>Sascha Meinrath</span></a><span>, founder of the</span><span> </span><a href="http://oti.newamerica.net/"><span>Open Technology Institute</span></a><span> at the New America Foundation. In a 2010</span><a href="http://newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Intl_Comparison_Cell_Phone_Plans_0.pdf"><span> study,</span></a><span> the institute found that the minimum cost of a complete cellphone package, which features voice, data and text, was $59.99 a month in the United States, compared with $32.40 in Britain. “Over the next decade,” Mr. Meinrath said, “U.S. consumers may overpay by over a quarter of a trillion dollars for worse levels of service than customers in other countries receive.” [</span><strong>The New York Times</strong><span>,</span><span> </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/business/two-countries-two-vastly-different-phone-bills.html?_r=0"><span>Two Countries, Two Vastly Different Phone Bills</span></a><span>,</span><span> </span><span>9/23/14</span><span>]</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>As the Washington Post reported, I've signed on to a coalition letter opposing the USA FREEDOM Act in my personal capacity.</strong> </span>"Sascha Meinrath, director of X-lab at the New American Foundation and the founder of the Open Technology Institute, is skeptical that the bill would effectively stymie bulk collection and signed on to the letter opposing the bill as an individual. Even experts on the matter, he says, have trouble determining the actual policy outcomes of the legislation because of the measure's "nebulous" language. People have different interpretations because the bill was written to create different interpretations," Meinrath says, adding that what opponents of the bills perceive as vagueness could be abused."

With this model, Podemos is sounding out ideas about itself and about its world."
