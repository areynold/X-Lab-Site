<h2>Commotion Tech Lab</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://commotionwireless.net">Commotion Wireless Project</a> is a global, open source development effort that X-Lab director, Sascha Meinrath, has been coordinating since it's founding in his living room in 2000.  Today, the opportunity exists to create a Commotion for-profit entity that provides a long-term sustainable funding stream for continuing this non-profit initiative.  Much as Ubuntu, Mozilla, and Red Hat have done for other open source projects, this effort will help ensure that free, safe communications is available to everyone on the planet.</p>

<h2>Circumvention Tech Audit Lab</h2>

<p>The Circumvention Tech Audit Lab is a one-stop lab combining capabilities 
to analyze evolving needs from communities and constituencies around the globe, 
incubate the development of new circumvention technologies, audit source code to 
improve existing solutions and improve security, provide a stamp of approval for 
technologies that pass rigorous testing procedures that help ensure secure communications, distribute these solutions worldwide, and provide legal protection for the users of these services and applications.</p>

<h2>PrivWare Lab</h2>

<p>The supermajority of today’s “Internet of Things” business models 
focus on commoditizing an ever-increasing array of private information 
(from biometrics to food consumption to psychometrics). Sometimes, 
however, smart is dumb: regardless of the locus of control over our 
personal information, often what we really want are devices that are 
simply incapable of data collection and information dissemination in the first place. </p>

<p>PrivWare is a privacy-centric alternative to the increasingly 
panoptic “Internet of Things” that places users in control of their devices and data.</p>

<h2>Distributed Production Lab</h2>

<p>New manufacturing technologies like 3-D printing are likely to create the 
collapse of many facets of the traditional manufacturing chain as they mature. 
The massive disruptions caused by distributed manufacturing have enormous implications 
for everything from patents to raw material supply chains, and impact sectors as 
diverse as transportation, energy, and retail.</p>

<h2>“Smart” Infrastructure Policy Lab</h2>

<p>A truly intelligent transportation and smart grid system requires everything 
from a major national fiber buildout, to far-reaching spectrum licensure reforms, 
to consumer protections over data collection practices. We should take advantages 
of the synergies between these two (often-siloed) sectors to develop an integrated 
plan that maximizes the utility of smart infrastructure for the general public.</p>
